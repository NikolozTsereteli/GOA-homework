    <h1>Introduction to the common zoo animals!</h1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>Lion</h2>

    <br>
    <p>
        A lion is a <b>large, muscular wild cat</b> known for its <strong>strength, power, and social nature.</strong>
        It has a <b>short, tawny-yellow coat, a long tail with a tuft of dark hair at the tip,</b>  <i>and in males</i>, <b>a distinctive mane of longer hair around the head and neck,</b> <em>which can range from light blond to dark brown.</em>
        Lions are unique among big cats because they live in social groups called <strong><em></em>prides</strong>, usually made up of <u>related females, their cubs, and a few males.</u>
        They are <i>carnivores</i> and <em>skilled hunters</em>, often working together to bring down large prey such as <b>zebras, antelopes, or buffalo.</b>
        Lions are native to parts of <strong>Africa and a small population exists in India (the Asiatic lion).</strong> They are often called the <strong><em><u>“king of the jungle”</u></em></strong>—though they typically live in <b>savannas and grasslands</b> rather than dense forests.

    <h2>Tiger</h2>

    <br>
    <br>
    <p>
        Tigers are the <strong>largest of all wild cats</strong> and <u>are known for their striking orange coats with black stripes, powerful build, and solitary nature.</u>
        <em>In the wild,</em> they live mainly in <b>Asia—in habitats</b> ranging from <u>tropical forests to snowy regions—depending on the subspecies (such as Bengal, Siberian, or Sumatran tigers).</u> <strong><em>Tigers are territorial and usually live alone, marking their ranges with scent and scratch marks.</em></strong> They are <b>skilled hunters,</b> using <u>stealth and strength</u> to catch prey like <em>deer and wild boar.</em>
        <em>In a zoo,</em> tigers are kept in <b>spacious enclosures that include water features, trees, and shaded areas since they</b> <strong><em><u>love swimming and cooling off.</u></em></strong> <b>They are given enrichment like logs,</b> <u><em>meat hung at different heights,</em></u> or scent trails to <b>encourage natural hunting and exploration behaviors.</b> <strong><em><u>Zoos also participate in breeding programs to protect endangered tiger subspecies and raise awareness about threats like habitat loss and poaching.</u></em></strong>

    <h2>Elephant</h2>

    <br>
    <br>
    <p>
        <strong>Elephants are the largest land animals on Earth,</strong> known for their <b>intelligence,</b> <i>strong social bonds,</i> and distinctive features like their <u>long trunks, large ears, and tusks.</u>
        <em>In the wild</em> there are <u>two main species</u> <b>—African elephants and Asian elephants—living</b> in habitats ranging from <i>savannas and forests to deserts and swamps.</i> They use their <strong>trunks for breathing, smelling, drinking, feeding, and communication.</strong> <em>Elephants live in close-knit family groups led by an older female called a matriarch, and they are highly <strong>social, showing emotions like joy, grief, and empathy.</strong></em>
        <em>In a zoo,</em> elephants are <b>housed in large, enriched enclosures</b> <i><u>with plenty of space to roam, mud or water pools for bathing,</u></i> <b>and items like logs or hanging feeders to keep them active.</b> <strong><em><u>Zoos focus on providing social companionship, as elephants thrive in groups, and often participate in breeding and conservation programs to help protect wild populations from threats like poaching and habitat loss.</u></em></strong>

    <h2>Giraffe</h2>

    <br>
    <br>
    <p>
        <strong>Giraffes are the tallest land animals,</strong> <em>famous for</em> <b>their extremely long necks and legs, as well as their unique spotted coat patterns, which are different for each individual.</b>
        <em>In the wild,</em> <b>they live mainly in </b> <i>African savannas and open woodlands,</i> <u>feeding on leaves, flowers, and fruits</u> <b>high up in trees—especially acacia trees—that most other animals cannot reach.</b> <strong><em>Despite their size, giraffes are gentle and social, often found in loose herds.</em></strong>
        <em>In a zoo,</em> <b>giraffes are kept in spacious enclosures with tall trees or specially designed feeders to mimic natural browsing.</b> <i>They are generally calm around visitors and often participate in public feeding sessions where people can give them leaves or vegetables.</i> <strong><em><u>Zoos help conserve giraffes by breeding them and raising awareness about threats in the wild, such as habitat loss and poaching.</u></em></strong>

    <h2>Zebra</h2>
    <img src="Zoo Zebra.jpg" alt="Oops, something went wrong!" width="500">
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>
        <strong>Zebras are medium-sized African herbivores known for their distinctive black-and-white striped coats, with each individual having a unique stripe pattern—almost like a fingerprint.</strong>
        <em>In the wild,</em> <b>they live in</b> <i>grasslands and savannas,</i> <u>grazing mostly on grasses but also eating leaves and bark when needed.</u> <b>Zebras are social animals, often found in herds for protection, and they rely on speed and agility to escape predators like lions and hyenas.</b> <em><u>Their stripes may help with camouflage, confusing predators, or even deterring biting insects.</u></em>
        <em>In a zoo,</em> <b><i>zebras are kept in open enclosures with plenty of space for grazing and running.</i></b> <i>They are usually housed with other African species,</i> <u>such as giraffes or antelopes,</u> <b>to create a more natural mixed-species habitat.</b> <strong><em><u>Zoos focus on educating visitors about zebra behavior and conservation, as some species—like the Grevy’s zebra—are considered endangered due to habitat loss and hunting.</u></em></strong>

    <h2>Monkey</h2>

    <br>
    <br>
    <p>
        <strong>Monkeys are intelligent, social mammals found in tropical forests, grasslands, and mountains across Africa, Asia, and Central and South America. They belong to the primate family and are generally divided into two groups: Old World monkeys <u>(like baboons and macaques)</u> and New World monkeys <i>(like capuchins and spider monkeys).</i></strong>
        <em>In the wild,</em> <b>monkeys live in groups called <i>troops</i></b>, where they use <i>vocal calls, facial expressions, and body language</i> <u>to communicate.</u> <b>They are highly adaptable and have varied diets</b> <em>—some eat fruits, leaves, and seeds, while others include insects or small animals.</em> <strong>Many monkeys are skilled climbers and use their tails <u>(especially prehensile tails in New World species)</u> for balance or even grasping objects.</strong>
        <em>In a zoo,</em> <b><i>monkeys are given large, enriched enclosures with climbing structures, ropes, and puzzle feeders to keep them active and engaged.</i></b> <i><u>They are popular with visitors due to their playful, curious nature, but they also require careful care because of their intelligence and complex social needs.</u></i> <strong><em><u>Some species are endangered, making zoos important for conservation and breeding programs.</u></em></strong>
