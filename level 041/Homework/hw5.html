    <p style="color: aqua; font-size: 20px; border: 20px solid aqua;">The hippopotamus is <strong>one of the largest animals</strong> living in Africa. They spend most of their time <u>in rivers and lakes</u>, <i>because their skin can dry out easily in the sun, and the water keeps them cool.</i> <em><strong>Even though they look slow, they are surprisingly fast and very dangerous if threatened.</strong></em>
    An adult hippo usually weighs between <em><strong><u>1,300 to 3,200 kilograms (around 3,000 to 7,000 pounds), making them the third-largest land animal after elephants and rhinos.</u></strong></em> They are extremely strong, with <b>powerful jaws</b> that can crush <i>almost anything</i> — <b><u>their bite force is among the strongest in the animal kingdom.</u></b>
    Hippos are <u>herbivores</u>; they mainly eat <i>grass</i>, and at night they leave the water to graze on land. <strong><em>A single hippo can eat up to 40 kilograms (88 pounds) of grass in one night.</em></strong>
    <strong><em><u>Despite being plant-eaters, they are considered one of the most dangerous animals in Africa, because of their size, strength, and aggressive nature.</u></em></strong> <b>They live in groups called pods or herds, usually led by a dominant male.</b></p>

        The word <b>“panther”</b> is often <u>used in two ways:</u> sometimes it means <i>any big cat</i> <b>(like leopards, jaguars, cougars)</b>, <em>but most often it refers to <strong>black leopards or black jaguars</strong> that have a dark coat due to a condition called melanism.</em>
        <u><i>Panthers are powerful carnivores, living in forests, swamps, and grasslands.</i></u> <b>They are excellent climbers and swimmers,</b> <i>moving quietly and hunting mostly at night.</i> <strong>Their diet includes deer, wild boar, small mammals, and sometimes birds.</strong>
        <strong><em>They can weigh between 30 to 90 kilograms (70 - 200 pounds) depending on the species, with muscular bodies, sharp claws, and very strong jaws.</em></strong> <u><b>Panthers are solitary animals, usually living and hunting alone, and they are known for their stealth and strength.</b></u>
        <strong><em><u>Even though they look mysterious and rare, they are not a separate species — they are actually leopards or jaguars with black fur.</u></em></strong>

        <b><i>Crocodiles are large reptiles that live in rivers, lakes, swamps, and coastal areas,</i></b> <u>mostly in tropical regions.</u> <strong><em>They spend much of their time in the water but can move quickly on land in short bursts.</em></strong>
        <i><u>They are among the strongest predators in the animal kingdom, with an extremely powerful bite</u></i> <strong><em>—the strongest of any animal alive today.</em></strong> <u>Adult crocodiles can weigh from 200 kilograms up to over 1,000 kilograms (440 - 2,200 pounds), depending on the species.</u>
        <b>Crocodiles are carnivores, eating fish, birds, and mammals that come close to the water.</b> <u>They often hunt by ambush, waiting quietly underwater and then striking with sudden speed.</u>
        <strong><em><u>They are ancient animals, having existed since the time of the dinosaurs, and they usually live long lives, often reaching 70 - 100 years.</u></em></strong>

        <strong><em><u>Kangaroos are large marsupials found only in Australia.</u></em></strong> <i>Kangaroos are known for their strong back legs and long tails, which help them balance while hopping.</i> <b><u>They can jump very far and reach speeds of over 50 km/h (30 mph).</u></b>
        <strong><em>Adult male kangaroos can weigh up to 90 kilograms (200 pounds), while females are usually smaller.</em></strong> <i><u>They live in groups called mobs, usually made up of a few females and one dominant male.</u></i>
        <b>Kangaroos are herbivores, eating mainly grass and leaves.</b> <strong><em><u>A baby kangaroo, called a joey, is born very small and develops inside its mother’s pouch until it is strong enough to live outside.</u></em></strong>
        <strong><u>Even though they look gentle, kangaroos can be quite strong and will kick with powerful legs if threatened.</u></strong>
